## Prettier

[prettier](https://prettier.io/) is
configured with my current standards and ready to go. These must be ran from
the CLI prior to commiting code in the following ways:

- `yarn run format` to apply the standards defined by eslint/prettier config.

Alternatively a GitHub action is in place to format on push to ensure formatting is complete.
